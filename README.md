This is my site for my portfolio page that I will be using to showcase skills to potential employers. 
I made this site and its project using react.
=======
This is my site for my portfolio page that provides a little bit of insight into myself. It was the perfect project to combine the 1-2 months of self-taught React development as I honed in that skillset to make this site. I hope to bring that same self-starter, ambitious spirit to a full career. This portfolio shows that sort of capability.

The site is hosted by Netlify and can be found at nckmartnez.com.
